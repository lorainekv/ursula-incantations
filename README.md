# Original Verses

Beluga, Sevruga  
Come winds of the Caspian Sea  
Larynxes, glossitis  
Et Max Laryngitis  
La voce to me  
*- "Poor Unfortunate Souls" in The Little Mermaid*

Mascara, tiara  
Yea, winds of the tropics appear  
Catharsis, lavorious  
Et qua manicurus  
mutato me here!  
*- from a "Poor Unfortunate Souls" Broadway show reprise draft*
